# Instructions:
#
# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year.
# A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.
# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
# on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder
# except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder
# unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder
# If english is not your first language or if the above logic is confusing,
# try using this flow chart .
# e.g. The year 2000:
# 2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)
# 2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
# 2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)
# So the year 2000 is a leap year.
# But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:
# 2100 Ã· 4 = 525 (Leap)
# 2100 Ã· 100 = 21 (Not Leap)
# 2100 Ã· 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)

year = int(input())
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print("Leap year")
        else:
            print("Not leap year")
    else:
        print("Not leap year")
else:
    print("Not leap year")
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
