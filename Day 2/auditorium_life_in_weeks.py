# Description:
# Create a program using maths and f-Strings
# that tells us how many weeks we have left,
# if we live until 90 years old.
#
# It will take your current age as the input
# and output a message with our time left in
# this format:
#
# You have x weeks left.

age = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print(f"You have {(90 * 52) - (int(age) * 52)} weeks left.")
